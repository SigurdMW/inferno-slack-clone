This project was bootstrapped with [Create Inferno App](https://github.com/infernojs/create-inferno-app) and then ejected to set up custom webpack config for [CSS Modules](https://github.com/gajus/react-css-modules).

The purpose is to create a working Slack clone using Inferno, Redux, CSS Modules and more. This project will (probably) not have a backend.
